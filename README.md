Project Spark is an innovative educational program designed to empower children with special needs to unlock their full potential. Through a range of engaging and interactive activities, children are encouraged to explore subjects that they often find boring in special schools. Our aim is to make learning fun and accessible for every child, regardless of their abilities.

## Features

- **Engaging Activities:** Our program offers a variety of activities tailored to the needs and interests of children with special needs.
- **Interactive Learning:** Children can interact with the content in a way that suits their learning style, whether through visuals, audio, or tactile experiences.
- **Personalized Progress Tracking:** Teachers and parents can track each child's progress and tailor the activities to their individual needs and abilities.
